## Requirements
- Anaconda (with Python installed)
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- Matlab

Curve Fitting Toolbox

Symbolic Math Toolbox

## Getting Started
* Download KNN models and place them in ``model/``.
* Download benchmark data and place them in ``validation_data/``.
* type ``matlab`` in Anaconda console.
* Open ``main.m``, change case study id, and run.
* Results will be saved in ``results/``.

## To Do
* Build the software as a fully Python package

## Acknowledgments
